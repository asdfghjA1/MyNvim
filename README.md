# MyNvim

This is a nvim total folder which is to be stored in Appdata/Local/nvim

if you dont have an nvim file there dont worry , just go to Appdata/Local from your Terminal
and type the following command 

git clone https://github.com/asdfghjA1/MyNvim 

rename the forlder MyNvim to nvim all lower case and just install the plugin but 
opening nvim and typing " :PlugInstall " THATS IT

and your nvim is good to go 

you can explore more and add new themes and other stuff

currently its on default VScode theme
